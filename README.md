In late July, South Korean scientists reported a breakgthrough in superconductors. They claimed that the LK-99 experiment was capable of transmitting electricity with no energy loss at room temperature and ordinary air pressure. This discovery could potentially revolutionize energy grids, quantum computing, and transportation systems.

However there was skepticism about LK-99, with experts arguing inconsistencies in the provided data. Replication of the LK-99 experiment faced challenges, leading to a couple of experiments and theoretical studies. Despite the initial excitement, the evidence suggested that LK-99 may not be exactly what was advertised.
